          - Self-esteem, self-image and society norms
            Many people values both self-esteem and self-image, as if these are one of the identity of oneself. One is worthless with low self-esteem and self-image. For me, there is no exception. I also believe the importance of self-esteem and self-image and I have to struggle to work on with it. Mostly, the self-esteem and self-image isn't very much influenced by the societal norms.
            My self-esteem and self-image wasn't influenced by societal norms because I have stayed almost all my life alone. In seventeen years I have lived a life ... 
            I am a perfectionist and this character has influenced on my view of self-esteem and self-image. I believe that a good self-esteem means that one must have confidence to do things and not feeling worthless about. To achieve the self-esteem, I believe that one must have a good self-image. Because if one is bad and constantly doing mistakes, it isn't possible to be confident in oneself. Therefore, a good self-image is the same as being perfect. For example, ... because the life is nothing but a race. My everyday quote is "If one can do anything, one must do everything". To achieve for having both good self-esteem and self-image, I have to be perfect. Then I have to solve the riddle of the life for being it because the human brain was never designed for being a decoration.
