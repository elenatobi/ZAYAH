# Management in Organizations | Top, Middle & Lower-Level - Lesson | Study.com
## Levels of Management

**Management** is the process of conducting business and accomplishing goals or objectives with the help of others. It consists of leading and monitoring a team's performance, organizing procedures and methods for operations, controlling different aspects of the business, and planning to improve efficiency. The term management may also sometimes be used to describe individuals who are in leadership positions within an organization.

A **manager** is an individual in a leadership position who is responsible for implementing these processes. They use both people and resources to achieve organizational goals. Within an organization or business, there are different types of managers. Some may be specialized to cover specific tasks, while others are broad, covering a variety of duties. These types of management positions may be categorized into three different levels of management. The three management levels include lower-level management, middle-level management, and top-level management. The tasks and strategies vary from top management to lower management positions as the focus shifts due to the change in the level of authority.
## Top-Level Management

The highest level of management within a business is the **top-level management**; this is the first of the three levels. The top management definition refers to the executive managers who lead the organization as a whole and have the most authority when making business decisions. They are the highest managers based on the hierarchical order of the organization. In larger businesses, these are generally the managers in the corporate office. In smaller businesses, these are generally the managers who own the business or have the most influence on business decisions. High level management may also be referred to as administrative management.

Upper-level management focuses on the mission of the company and strategizes about how to accomplish the main goals of the company. Top-level managers plan out procedures, duties, regulations, and systems for guiding the overall direction of the organization. They are also responsible for setting objectives for the staff to achieve. When it comes to major decisions about the organization, top-level managers are the ones who decide. Top-level managers may also be responsible for business-to-business matters, such as forming partnerships, as well as the branding and public relations aspects of the business.

Top-level management consists of several common positions:

- [Chief Executive Officer (CEO)](https://study.com/academy/lesson/chief-executive-officer-roles-responsibilities-ceo.html)
- Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
- Chief Operating Officer (COO)
- Company President
- Company Vice President

Depending on the structure of the organization, managers within this level may also have specific duties and roles. Top management may also include directors at the top of specialty departments, such as marketing, human resources, finance, and public relations.
## Middle-Level Management

What is middle-level management and how does it compare to top-level management? **Middle-level management** refers to the managers who are categorized in the middle of the hierarchical order. Middle-level managers make decisions and oversee the operations within their part of the organization. Middle managers take on the implementation part of the organization's objectives.

They ensure employees are able to execute tasks by allocating resources, implementing procedures, and promoting efficiency. These managers report to the top-level managers, giving them insight about the production, staffing, and overall progress of the organization. They essentially connect the top-level managers to the other employees of the company, acting as a liaison between the two.

Middle-level managers are different from top-level managers, as they are responsible for specific areas of the company, whereas top-level managers set the overall direction. The responsibilities of middle-level management are internal and focus within the organization, while the top-level management often conducts business externally with third parties. Middle managers typically have responsibility within a specific area, while top managers hold the most responsibility, making decisions for the company as a whole.

Some of the common [middle management](https://study.com/academy/lesson/middle-management-definition-roles-responsibilities.html) positions include:

- Operations Manager
- Branch Manager
- Regional Director
- Assistant Director
- Store Manager
- General Manager
- Division Manager

Depending on the industry and the position, middle managers may have additional duties. For example, middle managers may also train lower-level managers, which report directly to them. They may also need to identify issues within the processes of the organization and make any necessary requests when providing feedback to top-level management.
## Lower-Level Management

**Lower-level management** refers to the managers that supervise, coordinate, and delegate tasks directly to employees in their department. These are the entry-level managers of the organization, which may also be referred to as **[first-line managers](https://study.com/academy/lesson/first-line-management-overview-function.html)**. Managers generally start off in lower-level management positions due to having little experience.

Lower-level management is focused on interpersonal communication, since they mostly work directly with the employees in their department. They must ensure employees are efficient in their tasks and direct them with any necessary training. Lower-level management reports directly to middle-level management. Managers at this level act as a liaison between the staff and the middle managers, addressing any concerns or issues.

They have a variety of job titles, with some reflecting the specific department of the work that is completed. Some examples of positions that are categorized in lower-level management include:

- Department Manager
- Sales Manager
- Supervisor
- Office Manager
- Human Resource Manager
- Team Leader

## Managers in the Workforce

In today's fast-paced, competitive world, businesses are continually changing. Most of these organizations are on the hunt for the competitive advantage, or a way to strategically move ahead of the competition in the marketplace. However, earning the competitive advantage takes work; goals must be set, plans must be made, people must be motivated and mobilized, resources have to be gathered and distributed, and objectives have to be monitored and assessed.

Enter **managers**. These men and women come in many forms, but they all share the common task of working with people and resources to achieve organizational goals. An **organizational goal** can be something as simple as finding a way to shorten the amount of time it takes for a product to leave a warehouse or as elaborate as introducing a new product to the marketplace that makes all previous versions of this type of product obsolete. Regardless of the goal, someone needs to manage all of the factors necessary to seeing that goal become a reality.

Think of a manager as the foundation, support beams, and roof of a house. He or she provides the necessary support from the bottom up, and also provides oversight to all of the parts in between.

While this may seem like a great deal of responsibility and accountability for just one person to have, much like an onion, there are several layers of management. The roles and responsibilities a particular manager has correlates to their position in the organization. While job titles and roles can vary from organization to organization, they typically fall into one of three levels of management.

## Top-Level Managers

The first level of management is called **top-level management**. Top management is made up of senior-level executives of an organization, or those positions that hold the most responsibility. Jobs titles such as Chief Operating Officer (COO), Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), President, or Vice President are commonly used by top managers in organizations. These top managers are responsible for setting the overall direction of a company and making sure that major organizational objectives are achieved. Their leadership role can extend over the entire organization or for specific divisions such as finance, marketing, human resources, or operations.

## Middle-Level Management

The second layer of management is called **middle-level management**. This level of managers report to top management and serve as the head of major departments and their specialized units. Middle managers serve as a [liaison](https://study.com/academy/lesson/liaison-in-management-definition-lesson-quiz.html) between top managers and the rest of the organization from a very unique standpoint. They are typically much more visible to the greater workforce than top management, but they spend most of their time developing and implementing strategic actions plans needed to achieve the organizational goals set by top management.

Middle managers essentially have the important role of designing, selecting, and carrying out the best plan possible as a means of propelling a company towards its overall goals. Job titles of middle managers include Directors, Assistant Directors, Regional Directors, Division Managers, Deans, Branch Managers, Site Managers, and so on.

## Low-Level Management

The third and final layer of management is called **low-level management**. Low-level managers work most closely with the greater workforce and hold a much more [interpersonal role](https://study.com/academy/lesson/interpersonal-roles-in-management-types-definition-quiz.html) than any of the other levels of management. These managers work to ensure that individual employees are meeting their performance goals in a way that aligns with the organizational goals, such as completing a set number of projects by a specific deadline or selling a set number of products within a certain period of time. Titles of low-level managers can also vary significantly from company to company, but typically they resemble the department that they are situated in, such as accounting manager, academic affairs manager, human resources manager, head of financial operations, sales leader, and so on.

## Lesson Summary

Let's review.

Management is the use of people and resources to accomplish organizational objectives. **Managers** can come in many forms and serve a variety of functions. The roles and responsibilities of what a manager does can differ from organization to organization, but they are typically categorized into three levels: top-level management, middle-level management, and lower-level management.
